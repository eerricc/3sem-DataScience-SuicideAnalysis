# 3sem - Global Suicide Rates (1984–2016) - Data Science Project
> Hi, I’m Eric! I’d like to share a data science project I recently worked on. I used a dataset from Kaggle that tracks global suicide rates from 1984 to 2016. I chose this topic because it's complex, sensitive, and I felt it could reveal meaningful insights through careful analysis.

> This project is presented in a storytelling style, so you can follow my thought process step by step.

**Project Highlights**  

1) Data Preprocessing – Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis  
2) Exploratory Data Analysis – Understanding the data through patterns and trends
